                        I was born in Vietnam, a country adorned with diverse
                        breathtaking landscapes - Ha Long Bay is such an
                        instance. In 2019, I immigrated to America and embarked
                        on a new chapter of my life in Riverside County,
                        Southern California. I had a great time experiencing
                        many cool aspects in the area before relocating to
                        Northern California, a technology hub of the world.

                        Computer Science. Then I transfered to{" "}

                        are my interests. I'm passionate about crafting
                        innovative solutions and building practical
                        applications. Having that being said, Machine Learning
                        is on the rise and I'm willing to learn and integrate
                        ML-based features into applications as needed...
